## üêã Deployment

The easiest way to deploy the bot yourself is with Docker compose.

```yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  fuzzle:
    image: ghcr.io/avoonix/fuzzle-bot:latest # or latest-aarch64 for arm
    pull_policy: always
    command: serve
    environment:
      - FUZZLE_CACHE_DIR_PATH=/data/cache
      - FUZZLE_DB_FILE_PATH=/data/db.sqlite
      - FUZZLE_CONFIG_FILE_PATH=/config/config.toml
    ports:
      - "3000:3000" # admin interface
    volumes:
      - ./container-data:/data
      - ./config:/config
    restart: always
```

This example configuration ensures the service is always running. To start or update the service, use `docker compose up -d`. Keep in mind that it will sometimes be necessary to manually run migrations, as SQLite does not support many ALTER TABLE statements.

## üåà Development

Some useful commands:

```bash
cargo install sqlx-cli
cargo install --locked bacon
cargo install cargo-leptos
rustup toolchain install nightly --allow-downgrade
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

cargo leptos watch

cargo sqlx prepare -- --features ssr

export DATABASE_URL=sqlite:mydb.sqlite # for sqlx

# arguments won't work (yet); use environment variables to configure
# cargo run serve --tag-dir-path ./tags --db-file-path mydb.sqlite --config-file-path config.toml
bacon clippy
cargo fmt
leptosfmt ./**/*.rs

sqlx db create
sqlx migrate run # those two are usually not needed
```

After running `serve` for the first time, a configuration file will be created where you can add your Telegram token and your account id (this account will be able to run admin-only commands).

## üí¨ Help

The best place to get help are GitHub issues for now. 
If you have a more personal question, you can also contact me via telegram.

## üíæ Sticker Sets

Sets known to the bot are regularly crawled for sticker additions or deletions. 
New sets are not found automatically and the bot relies on users adding sets and tagging stickers.
So far, the majority of sets were gathered from sites/channesl like these: https://t.me/s/Fursticker, https://t.me/s/furrystickersfb, https://www.pulexart.com/stickers.html, and are not tagged.
Sets can be submitted sending stickers directly or by forwarding stickers or messages containing `t.me/addstickers/<set>` links.
